# Economic Analysis Report: Investment Performance and Inflation Impact (2005-2024)

## Introduction

This report analyzes how different investments have performed from 2005 to 2024, accounting for both market price changes and inflation's impact on purchasing power. Understanding these factors is crucial for making informed investment decisions and preserving wealth over time.

## Understanding Investment Value Over Time

When evaluating investment performance, we consider two key measures:

1. Nominal Value: The actual market price at any given time.
2. Real Value: The inflation-adjusted value that reflects actual purchasing power.

To understand the true performance of an investment, we need to look at how much purchasing power it has gained or lost, not just its price change.
